Overview:
A portfolio website to share my story and my skills.

Tools:
I will be using Gatsby, which is not something I have never used before.
One might argue that my portfolio is likely going to be my most viewed project and therefore I should stick to my guns, but on the other hand building with tools that are new to me is a good way to show versatility and adaptability, which I consider to be fairly important qualities for a web developer.

Approach:
The website is going to be designed with a device-agnostic mindset. That does pose some limitations and challenges, however it also defines clear guidelines for me to follow, which in many ways is better than having to start with a completely blank canvas. I would also like to make accessibility a priority in order to develop good habits ad practices in this regard.

A word about Context API:
I'm only getting started with Context API and I've been loving it so far. I was used to Effector as a state manager and Context API feels much more comfortable: it's leaps and bounds more readable, it has a much less convoluted syntax and wrapping something in a context provider makes the data flow crystal clear.
