Overview:
A portfolio website to share my story and my skills.

Tools:
I will be using Gatsby, which is not something I have ever used before.

One might argue that my portfolio is probably going to be my most viewed project and that therefore I should stick to my guns, but on the other hand building with tools that are new to me is a good way to show versatility and adaptability, which I consider to be fairly important qualities for a web developer.

Approach:
The website is going to be designed with a device-agnostic mindset. That does pose some limitations and challenges, however it also defines clear guidelines for me to follow, which in many ways is better than having to start from a completely blank canvas.I would also like to make accessibility a priority in order to develop good habits ad practices in this regard.
